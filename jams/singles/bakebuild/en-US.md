# 🎉 BakeBuild: Shape Your Sweet Wonder! 🍪

**BakeBuild** is your chance to turn imagination into a snackable reality! In this Hack Club YSWS (*You Ship We Ship*) event, you’ll design a custom cookie cutter, see it come to life through 3D printing, and have it shipped to your doorstep—complete with a cookie made using your unique design.

## What you will be doing here
* You will
    * Learn the basics of CAD by designing and creating your own cookie cutter
    * Get your cookie cutter printed out
    * Get cookies!!!!

## Getting Started
* First, sign up or log into [Onshape​](https://www.onshape.com/)
* Once you’re signed in, create a document and name it “Cookie Cutter” or something else relevant

## Picking a design
* Decide what you want to do​
    * Talk to your friends and brainstorm ideas​
    * Sketch an outline of it using either digital tools or paper
* Find something that has a simple outline, like this loch ness monster!

* Once you’ve got your outline, save an image of it to your computer and return to Onshape!

## Importing the image into onshape
* Now that you have your template, we can start designing!​
* Click the plus sign next to studio parts (far right bottom corner)​
    * A dropdown menu should appear​
    * Click on the last option “import”​
* Select your chosen file and click “open”​
* A loading bar will appear and tell you once your image has been successfully imported

## Insert the picture
* Now it’s time to add the image!​
* Create a sketch on the top plane and insert the photo ​
* Using the dropdown from “Insert DXF or DWG,” click on “Insert Image”​
* An option to insert an image will appear
![](https://cloud-i4xfog8ph-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image7.png)
* Choose your image from the pop-up​
* Click on the pane you want to drag to draw your image​
* DO NOT CONFIRM YOUR SKETCH YET

## Dimension
* Use the dimensioning tool to change the size of your picture​
* In general, your outline probably shouldn’t be over 4in x 4in or 100mm x 100mm
![](https://cloud-jverinan3-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/1image9.png)


## Tracing
* Once you have your image inserted and properly dimensioned, you can start tracing!​
* Use the spline tool and click along your outline to trace it out!​
    * Note that you can edit the points of your spline after confirming it but you cannot undo any (DO NOT TRY UNDOING WHILE MAKING THE OUTLINE)​
* Once you’re happy with your outline, confirm your sketch by clicking on the green checkmark​

## 3D time
* Once your sketch is confirmed, click the extrude tool and choose “thin” ​
* Then select the outline of your sketch​
![](https://cloud-11umbk5i1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image11.png)
* Now you can change the thickness​
* I find that  2mm/.08in work best​
* Then choose the depth​
* You’re going to want this to be about 12.7mm/0.5 in​
* Confirm the Extrude

## Pretty little border​
* Click extrude again​
* Select the bottom side of the extrude and use thin to make a pretty border​
    * Thickness ~ 5mm​
    * Depth ~ 2mm

## ADMIRE IT!​
* Look at your finished design!​
* Isn’t it pretty?​
* Feel happy and proud ​
* …until you realize that there is still more page to scroll

## Screenshot
* Take a screenshot of your design (like so) and save it to your computer​
* You will need this for submission
![](https://cloud-11umbk5i1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/3image14.png)

## Export
* Now it’s time to export it!​
* Right click the “part studio” tab where you made your whole design ​
* Select “export”
![](https://cloud-11umbk5i1-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/4image15.png)
* A pop up will appear​
* Name your file something relevant and boring like ​“Cookie Cutter” again​
* Select “STEP” for the format​
